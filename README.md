Simple DirectX 11 project using DirectXTK to play with Normal Mapping and Gloss Mapping.
Replaces the DirectXTK standard effect types with a version that allows for writing custom vertex and pixel shaders to play around with.

Recommended for building: (although should still build after retargetting these in VS)
-Windows SDK 10.0.16299.0
-Platform Toolset v141

(Tested on VS 2017 Community Edition with Windows 10)
